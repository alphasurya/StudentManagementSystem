# Student Management System 📚

A simple console-based Student Management System built in Java, using object-oriented programming principles. This project demonstrates basic CRUD operations like adding, listing, and searching students.

---

## 💡 Features

- Add a new student with name, age, roll number, and course.
- Display all students.
- Search student by roll number.
- Simple and interactive menu-driven CLI interface.


## 🛠 Problems I Solved Through This Project
Working on this Student Management System allowed me to solve several real-world and technical problems:

How to Apply OOP in a Real Project
→ I understood how to structure Java classes using inheritance and encapsulation. I created a base Person class and extended it with a Student class to avoid code duplication and make the code more modular.

How to Store and Manage Multiple Records Without a Database
→ I implemented an in-memory data storage system using arrays, and managed student data with basic logic without relying on any external tools.

How to Build a Simple CRUD Application
→ I learned how to implement Create (Add), Read (List/Search), and Exit operations using console-based input/output.

How to Take Input Efficiently Using Scanner
→ I handled issues related to Scanner like skipping inputs after reading integers, and ensured clean and user-friendly input flow.

How to Build a Menu-Driven CLI Application
→ I created a looping menu that responds to user input and provides a smooth experience while using the program.

How to Write Clean, Understandable Java Code
→ I learned how to separate logic using packages like model, service, and main which helped me follow a structured coding approach.

How to Solve Real-life Student Data Problems
→ I simulated a real-world situation where a college or coaching center needs to store and search student records efficiently without any GUI or DB.

### 💼 Project Description

The Student Management System is a console-based Java application that allows users to manage student records through a simple text interface. It uses basic Java concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and arrays.

---

### ✅ Objectives

- Understand object-oriented programming.
- Learn how to build a basic CRUD system.
- Improve CLI handling in Java.

---

### 📁 Modules

-   Person.java  : Base class with common fields `name` and `age`.
-   Student.java  : Extends `Person`, includes additional fields `roll` and `course`.
-   StudentService.java  : Handles storage (using array) and logic for adding, displaying, and searching.
-   Main.java  : Contains the user interface and menu system.

---

### ⚙ Functionality

1.   Add Student   – User can input name, age, roll number, and course.
2.   Print All Students   – Lists all student data.
3.   Search by Roll Number   – Retrieves specific student data.
4.   Exit   – Ends the program.

### 📌 Conclusion

The Student Management System helped me understand Java basics and implement real-world logic using arrays and OOP concepts. This project can be enhanced in the future using file handling or database integration.
